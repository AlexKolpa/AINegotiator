\section{Bidding strategy}

The report should include an explanation of the negotiation strategy, decision function for accepting offers, any important preparatory steps, and heuristics that the agent uses to decide what to do next, including the factors that have been selected and their combination into these functions.

2c) Implement the bidding strategy (Groupn BS). Decide on the way your agent will make its
first offer and counter offers. Explain why you have chosen this to be the agent’s opening bid
and how your agent computes a counter offer. List all considerations that your agent takes
into account explicitly and explain why you have chosen to base the agent’s decision on these
considerations.
Does your agent ever propose offers that increase the utility for itself relative to its previous
bid? If not, demonstrate that the utility associated with bids in any bid sequence your agent
will ever propose in a negotiation monotonically decreases. If it does, explain when and why it
will decide to do this.
Finally, the source and compiled class should be placed in the folder “negotiator/group3/” relative
to the root of Genius as “Group3 AS.class” and “Group3 AS.java” and added to the BOA
repository.
