\section{Opponent model and strategy}

The report should include an explanation of the negotiation strategy, decision function for accepting offers, any important preparatory steps, and heuristics that the agent uses to decide what to do next, including the factors that have been selected and their combination into these functions.

2e) Implement the opponent model (Groupn OM). As an example of how to create an opponent
model we refer to the included example code of the HardHeaded Frequency Model. Describe
how your model differs from this opponent model and how the models compare with regard to
quality.

2f) (Optionally) Implement the opponent model strategy (Groupn OMS). For this assignment
you may improve the opponent model strategy “Best bid” which is included in this distribution
or design your own opponent model strategy. A hint for an alternative implementation is to
keep in mind that opponent models are imperfect.
