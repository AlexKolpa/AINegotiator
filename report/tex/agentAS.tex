\section{Acceptance strategy}

The report should include an explanation of the negotiation strategy, decision function for accepting offers, any important preparatory steps, and heuristics that the agent uses to decide what to do next, including the factors that have been selected and their combination into these functions.

2d) Implement the acceptance strategy (Groupn AS). Describe which factors the agent takes into
account for making this decision. Does your agent take time and/or opponentâ€™s actions into
account when deciding to accept an offer? In case your agent also uses other considerations to
determine whether it will accept particular bids, also explain these considerations.
