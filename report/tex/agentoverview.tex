\chapter{Design of the negotiation agent}
\section{Problem formulation}
2a) Create a PEAS description in the same format of a table as in [14] of the negotiation agent that you need to design and implement in this assignment. Use this negotiation assignment setup as the task environment. Be as complete as possible and pay special attention to the performance measure of the agent. Also include a brief discussion about each element included in your PEAS description. In particular, explain informally what goals the agent has in a negotiation.

\section{Agent overview}

The report should include a high-level description of the agent and its structure, including the main Java methods (mention these explicitly!) used in the negotiating agent that have been implemented in the source code.

2b) For implementing the agent we will be using the BOA agent framework as discussed in [1] and the userguide. The main advantage of this framework is that you can benefit from using a large set of existing components. Provide a small description of the role of each component in the BOA framework.
