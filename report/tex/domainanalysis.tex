\section{Analysis of the party domain}

1a) Using the GUI, inspect the negotiation template named \texttt{party\_domain.xml} and the utility profiles that are provided to you in the negotiation environment bundle. Compute and draw the efficient frontier in a graph such as Figure 3 for two of the templates provided to you.

\section{Performance of simple agents}

1b) Analyze the performance of the agent \texttt{SimpleAgent} in the party domain playing against itself. Is a Pareto optimal outcome reached? Explain your answer. Also explain why it obtains the resulting outcome that it does. Do the same for \texttt{Boulware} playing vs. \texttt{Conceder}.
