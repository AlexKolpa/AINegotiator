\section{Mediation instead of negotiation}
4) As you will have noticed by now, it is hard to find deals that are Pareto optimal. An alternative
for one-to-one negotiation as used in this practical assignment is to use a trusted mediator to which
each agent declares its private preferences. The mediator then will compute an efficient outcome
using this input. Do you think that introducing a mediator is a better option for finding an optimal
outcome for both agents? If so, argue why you think so and describe the circumstances in which it
is particularly suitable to use a mediator. If not, argue why you think it is not useful to do this.

\section{Increasing negotiation capabilities}
5) The agents in the negotiation environment have limited capabilities in order to achieve a negotiated
deal. Think about capabilities (e.g. other actions or forms of communication) that an agent might be
extended with. Can you think of additional capabilities that would help an agent to achieve a better
deal? If so, explain why these capabilities would help an agent to achieve a better deal. If not, argue
why there will not be any capabilities that could help an agent achieve a better deal.
